## Technical terms
bps= bits per second. k=kilo=2^10 =1024.

I just followed the naming convention of Cubase 11.0 like capital letters in filename kBps, but it does not mean bytes but actually bits per seconds. 1 Byte = 8bit, 1 kilobit = 1024 bit = 128 Byte. For bit depth of mp3 is not fixed and I cannot designate bit depth but the original Cubase project file used 24bit depth and 48kHz sample rate
